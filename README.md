**Exploring Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling Dzhanibekov Oscillation (ECDO) Theory through open-source data and simulations.**

ECDO is an emerging theory concerning potential Earth core-mantle dynamics with implications for geophysics, planetary science and humanity. This repo aims to serve as the open-source hub for progress towards a more perfect Earth digital twin for unlocking improved ECDO simulations and resilience planning.

## Current Status
- **Alpha Phase**: Early testing — Visit [ECDOsimulator.com](https://ecdosimulator.com) for custom simulations (accepting crypto payments).
- Open Source: Working on initial Earth digital twin model for inclusion in this rep.

## Roadmap
- Enhance Earth model integrity towards a high-fidelity digital twin.
- Integrate higher-resolution simulation capabilities.
- Expand community-contributed datasets and tools.

## Get Involved
- **[Donate](https://ecdosimulator.com/donate)** or **[Purchase](https://ecdosimulator.com/store)**: a public or private ECDO simulation for a location of interest at [ECDOsimulator.com](https://ecdosimulator.com).
- **Contribute**: Submit PRs with data, streams, or ideas for the digital twin.
- **Community**: Join discussions on the website or star/watch this repo for updates.
- **Feedback**: Open issues for suggestions or bugs.
